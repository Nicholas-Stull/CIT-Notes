# import date class from datetime module



# create the date object of today's date and legal age requirement variable




#collecting user input regarding their first and last name along with their current age


#create a function that calculates the difference between legal age and current age and then returns a value


#print user information ensuring to capitalize user's first and last name using the f function. The user's age should also be printed on the same sentence



#Develop an if statement to determine if the user is too young to run for president
#If the user is old enough, you should print a statement that states "You are old enough to run for president"
#If the user is not old enough, you should develop an else statement that calls a function to determine the age gap and then print the following
#Wait until you turn (legal age variable) years old to run for the office of President. Which should be in about (function variable) years from (today's date variable)
